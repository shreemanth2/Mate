 # Project .npmrc — modified by assistant to avoid Proxy 407 during install
 # The org-scoped registry below pointed @jsr packages at an internal registry
 # that requires proxy authentication (HTTP 407). Commented out so npm will
 # use the default public registry unless you intentionally need the internal one.
# @jsr:registry=https://npm.jsr.io

# If you need the internal registry for CI or corporate packages, restore the
# line above or add a per-session registry with:
#   npm config set @jsr:registry https://npm.jsr.io
